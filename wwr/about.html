      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Exciting Expeditions was founded in 1995 by a group  of adventure enthusiasts who wanted to share their love 
        for the great outdoors.  Starting with just a handful of rafts and a passion for exploration, the company has 
        grown into a leading provider of whitewater rafting experiences. And also founded in the spirit of adventure, 
        our company began with a single raft and a big dream. Today, we’ve grown into a team of passionate guides sharing
         unforgettable river journeys with thousands of adventurers.
