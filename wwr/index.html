      <h3>Our History</h3>
      <p>
        Exciting Expeditions was founded in 1995 by a group of adventure enthusiasts who wanted to share their love 
        for the great outdoors. Starting with just a handful of rafts and a passion for exploration, the company has 
        grown into a leading provider of whitewater rafting experiences. Founded in the spirit of adventure, our company 
        began with a single raft and a big dream. Today, we have grown into a team of passionate guides sharing 
        unforgettable river journeys with thousands of adventurers.
