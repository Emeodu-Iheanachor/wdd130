        Hello! I am Emeodu Raphael Chidiebere Iheanachor by name, and I am from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. 
        I like administrative work as well as job analysis and design.... I am currently studying Web Design and Development at BYU. 
        I am blissful to learn more about Web Development and Design. I am looking forward to creating my own "website" 
        and getting more acquainted about the labour-market. To crown it all, I am very much happy to see what the future holds for me.... Cheers!

        A PREAMBLE of Port Harcourt. Port Harcourt was founded in 1912 by the British colonial government to export coal from Enugu and palm oil from the hinterland. 
        Named after Lewis Harcourt, the colonial secretary, it was initially built on IguochÃ¡, the farmland of the Diobu village group. 
        The city expanded significantly after the discovery of oil in 1956, becoming the center of the Nigerian oil economy, 
        though also a hub for industrial and commercial activity in the Eastern Region...!
