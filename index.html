  <p>A PREAMBLE of Port Harcourt.  Port Harcourt was founded in 1912 by the British colonial government to export coal from Enugu and palm oil from the 
  hinterland. Named after Lewis Harcourt, the colonial secretary, it was initially built on IguochÃ¡, the farmland of the 
  Diobu village group. The city expanded significantly after the discovery of oil in 1956, becoming the center of the Nigerian
  oil economy, though also a hub for industrial and commercial activity in the Eastern Region...! </p>
